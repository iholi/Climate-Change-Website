        <h3> What is climate change?  </h3>
        <p> is a change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns when that change lasts for an extended
            period of time (i.e., decades to millions of years). Climate change is caused by factors such as biotic
            processes, variations in solar radiation received by Earth, plate tectonics, and volcanic eruptions. Certain
            human activities have been identified as primary causes of ongoing climate change, often referred to as
            global warming

        <h3> Causes and Consequences of Climate Changes </h3>

        <h1> Causes of Climate Change </h1>

        <p>
            Humans are increasingly influencing the climate and the earth's temperature by burning fossil fuels, cutting
            down rainforests and farming livestock.
            <br>This adds enormous amounts of greenhouse gases to those naturally occurring in the atmosphere,
            increasing the greenhouse effect and global warming.<br>
        </p>

        <h2> Greenhouse gases </h2>

        <hr>
        <p>
            <img src="images/greenhouse-gases-chart.jpg" alt="Greenhouse gases" style="width:350px;height:150px;">
            Some gases in the Earth's atmosphere act a bit like the glass in a greenhouse, trapping the sun's heat and
            stopping it from leaking back into space.

            <br> Many of these gases occur naturally, but human activity is increasing the concentrations of some of
            them in the atmosphere, in particular: <br>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li> carbon dioxide (CO2) </li>
            <li> methane </li>
            <li> nitrous oxide </li>
            <li> fluorinated gases </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            CO2 is the greenhouse gas most commonly produced by human activities and it is responsible for 64% of
            man-made global warming. Its concentration in the atmosphere is currently 40% higher than it was when
            industrialisation began.

            <br>Other greenhouse gases are emitted in smaller quantities, but they trap heat far more effectively than
            CO2, and in some cases are thousands of times stronger. Methane is responsible for 17% of man-made global
            warming, nitrous oxide for 6%.<br>
        </p>

        <h2> Causes for rising emissions </h2>
        <hr>
        <img src="images/giphy.gif" alt="Rising emissions" style="width:340px;height:150px;" class="img1">
        <ul>
            <li>Burning coal, oil and gas produces carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide.</li>
            <li>Cutting down forests (deforestation). Trees help to regulate the climate by absorbing CO2 from the
                atmosphere. So when they are cut down, that beneficial effect is lost and the carbon stored in the trees
                is released into the atmosphere, adding to the greenhouse effect.
            </li>
            <li>Increasing livestock farming. Cows and sheep produce large amounts of methane when they digest their
                food.
            </li>
            <li>Fertilisers containing nitrogen produce nitrous oxide emissions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Consequences of climate change</h1>

        <h2>Melting ice and rising seas</h2>

        <hr>
        <p>When water warms up it expands. At the same time global warming causes polar
            ice sheets and glaciers to melt.

            The combination of these changes is causing sea levels to rise, resulting in flooding and erosion of coastal
            and low lying areas.

        <h2>Extreme weather, shifting rainfall</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <img src="images/big_climateshifts.jpg" alt="Extreme weather, shifting rainfall" style="width:380px;height:150px;">
            Heavy rain and other extreme weather events are becoming more frequent. This can lead to floods and
            decreasing water quality, but also decreasing availability of water resources in some regions.
        </p>

        <h2>Risks for human health</h2>

        <p>Climate change is already having an impact on health:            </p>

        <ul class="list">
            <li>  There has been an increase in the number of heat-related deaths in some regions and a decrease in
                cold-related deaths in others.
            </li>
            <li>   We are already seeing changes in the distribution of some water-borne illnesses and disease vectors.
